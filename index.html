We're accustomed to relying on the support and generosity of folks who previous generations may have called strangers.

				<p>‘Supernatural’ is a science fiction show about brothers Dean and Sam Winchester. They live in a black 1967 Chevy, drive across the country, and find and destroy demons. At the end of the day, they have a beer and they drive on to their next destination.</p>

				<img src="images/sam-dean-beer-car.gif">

				<p>Somehow, Supernatural has one of one of the largest fan fiction communities on the internet. It’s bigger than Harry Potter, The Avengers or Sherlock. Fan fiction is, of course, what happens when fans write fresh storylines set in an existing fictional universe.</p>

				<p>Why is this show so popular among the fan-fiction community? It has to do with its strong emphasis on family. In particular, fan writers seem to be inspired by the complicated dynamics between Dean and Sam. For example, one fan found inspiration in the brothers’ emotional journey. The makers of the show know that, andt they play with it.</p>

				<p>My friend Hans Bekhart noticed the subtextual homoerotic tension, and she ran with it.</p>

				<p>In Bekhart’s 4,448-word story about Supernatural, Dean and Sam’s brotherly love turns incestuous, as you may have guessed. Dean resists Sam’s kiss at first... he tells Sam not to follow his sexual urges. </p>

				<div class="blockquote">
					<p>&ldquo;Why not?,&rdquo; asks Sam.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; Dean says.</p>
					<p>&ldquo;Says who?&rdquo; Sam whispers back</p>
					<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that to you, Sammy,&rdquo; Dean breathes, but he doesn&rsquo;t move away.</p>

				</div>


				<p>This scene might seem silly, but incestuous sexual acts between Sam and Dean are hardly the full story. On the back on that premise, Hans created a complex emotional framework and gives the characters depth far beyond what’s shown on TV.</p>

				<p>Some say the fan-fiction movement <a href="http://fanlore.org/wiki/Fanfiction" target="_blank">started in the late 1960s,</a> when fans extended the stories of Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock and passed them around in zines. But the medium didn’t really come into its own until the advent of the internet. One of the most popular fan fiction sites, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/" target="_blank">FanFiction.Net</a>,  touted close to 3 million registered users in 2011, <a href="http://ffnresearch.blogspot.ca/2011/03/fan-fiction-demographics-in-2010-age.html" target="_blank">one study said</a>.</p>

				<p>Another interesting tidbit from the study? The userbase of that fanfiction site was 78% women.</p>

				<p>For Bekhart, this kind of community existed on Live Journal. Between 2005 and 2009, Bekhart posted around 667 journal entries and fan-fiction stories.</p>

				<p>In those four years, she exchanged roughly 12,458 messages with her fans in the comment section. In one story alone — the one that established her in the community — there were 197 comments.</p>

It just became easier not to fight.

				<p>This post explains it:</p>
				<div class="blockquote">
					<p>The more I think about how to say this, the worse it is. There's no good way to do it. I miscarried the baby. I had a miscarriage. Nothing. It's hard to even type. We were given an early ultrasound - something having to do with detecting Down's Syndrome, and there was no heartbeat. They estimate that it probably happened a week ago. Eight weeks. The most common time to miscarry.</p>
				</div>



				<div class="character">
					<p>Hans Bekhart</p>
					<span class="soundcite" data-time="57" data-url="http://quantifiedselfie.us/yourfan/assets/hb-cuts6-miscarriage-intv" data-start="0" data-end="57" data-plays="1">&ldquo;So I found out I was pregnant. And I was overjoyed. I was 23, i had a part-time job at a cafe, I was very broke, but I'm also a very stubborn person who sees meaning in the different events that happen in your life and at the time it seemed like this was something that was meant to happen. And i decided to keep the baby with every part of me wanted that baby. I was so excited to be a mother and to feel the heartbeat and to feel all the physical things that happen inside you. When you're pregnant. i was in love with every moment of it. and then i had what they called a missed miscarriage. Where i woke up one morning and suddenly this little voice that i had inside me was quiet, just wasn't there anymore.&rdquo;</span>
				</div>

				<p>She didn’t post for a month after the miscarriage. She was grieving. After years of being in an isolated relationship, she was left alone with the pain.</p>

				<div class="character">
					<p>Hans Bekhart</p>
					<span class="soundcite" data-time="43" data-url="http://quantifiedselfie.us/yourfan/assets/hb-cuts8-nobodywasthereb" data-start="0" data-end="43" data-plays="1">&ldquo;Nobody in my real life was sad about me losing the baby. No one. Nobody said I'm sorry for your loss. What people say instead is 'It's probably for the best.'&rdquo;</span>
				</div>

				<p>Bekhart’s boyfriend stopped talking to her after the miscarriage. He drank all day, every day. He stayed out late after work. Instead of coming home, he did lots of drugs. Bekhart felt abandoned.</p>

				<p>But her live journal community never left. They raised money for her when her boyfriend refused to pay for medical bills. And most importantly, they showed their support by sharing stories.</p>

				<div class="character">
					<p>Hans Bekhart</p>
					<span class="soundcite" data-time="62" data-url="http://quantifiedselfie.us/yourfan/assets/hb-cuts9-angryinternetc" data-start="0" data-end="62" data-plays="1">&ldquo;I didn't know anybody who had had a miscarriage. So what happened online was that people started emailing me that had read my fan fiction and had become friends to tell me that they had had 2 miscarriages, that they had had 5 miscarriages, it was something that still hurt them, it was something they healed from, it became something that I could experience with people who knew what it felt like. </br> </br> The first person that ever made me feel angry about what had happened to me was somebody I knew in fandom. After the breakup I had posted about it and there were dozens of people saying 'gosh, that's so sad. I'm so sorry for you.' and one person said 'Fuck that guy. That guy did wrong by you. These people are doing wrong by you.'</br></br> I don't think she has any idea about how much that meant to me and how transformative it was. Because I didn't think I could be angry on my own behalf. I didn't think that I deserved it&rdquo;</span>
				</div>

				

				<p>Bekhart’s story started in 2005. It was the year before Twitter was created and one year before Facebook allowed anyone from the public to sign on. Her story is one of the earliest iterations of what we see now: an arc in which someone finds support in an online community, engages with the community, and grows within it. Over time, they grow from being sidekicks to being protagonists and even heroes within their niche. They give to their community and the community, in turn, gives back.</p>
